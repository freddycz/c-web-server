# c-web-server
Simple web server written in C that responds to GET requests and serves static files from a specified directory. 

## Motivation
This project was created to deepen my understanding of how HTTP works under the hood and to learn the basics of network programming. I wanted to explore how web servers handle client requests and responses at a low level.

## Disclaimer
This server only implements response handling for GET requests and ignores HTTP headers. It is a learning experimental project, and not intended for production use.
